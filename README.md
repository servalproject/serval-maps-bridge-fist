# Serval Maps Bridge Template #

The Serval Maps Bridge Template is an [Android](http://www.android.com) application that is designed to provide a template for bridging [Serval Maps](http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:servalmaps:main_page) with an external website or service. 

The current version of the Serval Maps Bridge Template application provides the minimum amount of functionality required to upload Point of Interest Information into another website using JSON. 

More information about using the template application to implement a bridge into your own system is available in the [Serval Project wiki](http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:servalmaps:bridgetemplate).
